I am a PhD Candidate in Industrial Engineering at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), under the guidance of Prof. [Stephen Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). I also hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to my time in Madison, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

My research is centered on the design and analysis of optimization algorithms for machine learning applications.

**I am actively seeking machine learning engineer/scientist, or quantative researcher positions in the industry!**

Check out my CV [here](/resume/resume.pdf).
