I am an Industrial Engineering PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Stephen Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/).

Before coming to Madison, I received my B.S. in Mathematics at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

My current research interests are machine learning, non-convex optimization and differentially private optimization methods.

Check out my CV [here](/resume/resume.pdf).
